            With the acquisition by Google for an amount close to 50 million
            dollars, Android begins to become an operating system for mobile
            devices. In 2010 the Google vice-president David Lawee defined the
            acquisition of Android the best deal that the company ever did.

            In November 2007 the Open Handet Alliance was unveiled. This is a
            consortium composed of several technology companies and led by
            Google, with the goal of developing "the first truly open and
            comprehensive platform for mobile devices". This consortium was
            formed by Google, some chipset makers (like Intel and Qualcom) and
            the brand that will release devices with the Android OS, such as
            Samsung, LG and Motorola.

            This device had a physical keyboard, but its commercialization was

            device is the ancestor of the famous Samsung Galaxy S series.
            Nowadays Samsung is the company producing Android Smartphones with

            exclusively for this type of device called AndroidWear, which will
            be renamed Wear OS in 2018. This OS was used in many devices of

            In May 2019 the Android operating system became entangled in the
            trade war between China and the United States started by the US
            president Donald Trump. As a result, Huawei was no longer able to
            offer the Google services on its phones and lost its market share
            world widely. In the summer of 2019, Huawei announced it would
            create an alternative operating system to Android known as Harmony
            OS. This is the first case in which a company which was producing
            Android phones developed its own operating system.
