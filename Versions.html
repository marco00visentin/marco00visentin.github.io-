            <h3>Android 1.0 Alpha</h3>
            <p>
              On September 23, 2008, Android version 1.0 was released, which
              included the market, browser, folder management (creating,
              deleting, and renaming folders), access to e-mail services and
              support for Wi-Fi networks, camera, and the first Google apps for
              Android smartphones; multitasking is already available, as well as
              background operation of apps.

            <h3>Android 1.5 Cupcake</h3>
            <p>
              The first version with an official name is therefore Android 1.5
              Cupcake, which brings API 3, introducing widgets, text prediction
              and support for custom keyboards. The version is released on 13
              April 2009 and obviously maintains compatibility with previous
              versions. There is no end to the new features, which include the
              ability to record videos, support for Bluetooth accessories,
              photos in contact tabs, screen rotation and better integrations
              with Google services, such as the ability to upload a video to
              YouTube or a photo to Picasa.

            <p>
              Just five months later, the development team released the next
              version, officially released on 15 September 2009, called Android
              1.6 Donut. It is not a revolutionary update, as the new features
              include support for CDMA networks, search within the smartphone
              and new functions for the gallery. Android Market, the precursor
              to Google Play Store, is being revamped, highlighting the best
              free and paid apps, taking advantage of the rapidly growing
              catalogue of third-party products.

            <h3>Android 2.0 Eclair</h3>
            <p>
              The first major update was released on 27 October 2009, just over
              a month after the previous one. Android 2.0 Eclair, followed on 12
              January 2010 by Android 2.1 Eclair (which only offers a few bug
              fixes) represents a major improvement in the history of the green
              dot. Microsoft Exchange support, the possibility to manage several
              e-mail accounts, a refresh in the design of the main applications,
              voice input with the microphone key inserted in the keyboard
              instead of the comma, animated wallpapers on the Home Page and the
              Google Maps navigator arrived. The latter in particular brings
              step-by-step directions, 3D view and voice guidance. Although not
              bringing significant new features, Android 2.1 Eclair makes
              history for being the operating system used by Nexus One, the
              first Google-branded smartphone produced by HTC, which was later
              upgraded to versions 2.2 and 2.3.

            <p>
              Another few months passed and Google released Android 2.2 Froyo on
              20 May 2010. The little green robot was enriched with many
              functions, but the interface did not change significantly. Push
              notifications arrive, WiFi hotspot is introduced to surf from
              other devices using the smartphone's connectivity. The Dalvik JIT
              compiler is introduced and with voice actions you can search, set
              alarms, take notes and much more. Applications can be installed on
              SD cards and updated via OTA.

            <h3>Android 2.3 Gingerbread</h3>
            <p>
              Before the end of 2010, Google released Android 2.3 Gingerbread,
              which debuted on the Nexus S, the first smartphone made in
              collaboration with Samsung. Google's plan to release a new
              reference device along with new versions of Android becomes clear.
              In this way, developers and manufacturers can immediately see the
              potential of the new system. The new version of Android introduces
              support for large screens, support for NFC (Near Field
              Communication) technology, new audio effects, a download manager,
              support for multiple cameras (including the front-facing one) and
              new APIs dedicated to game developers. Battery management was
              introduced, allowing precise information on the consumption of
              each individual function and application. It was with Android 2.3
              Gingerbread that Google introduced Easter Eggs, which can be
              revealed by going to Settings - Device Info and repeatedly tapping
              on the Android version entry. The story of the first Android
              Easter Egg deserves to be told: Dianne Hackborn, head of the
              Android framework team, becomes friends with artist Jack Larson,
              who paints zombies of all kinds. Hackborn thinks it is fun to have
              a painting with a zombie gingerbread man and the painting is so
              popular that it is hidden inside the operating system, becoming a
              tradition that continues to this day.

            <h3>Android 3.0 Honeycomb</h3>
            <p>
              On 27 January 2011, Android 3.0 Honeycomb, the only release of the
              green dot dedicated exclusively to tablets, hit the market. The
              user interface is completely redesigned, although not designed for
              smartphones, and introduces Google's first design language, called
              Holo. Screen navigation controls are introduced, avoiding the need
              to use physical buttons even on tablets. New Quick Settings
              arrive, allowing the time, battery status and connectivity status
              to be displayed in a single section. Support is added for
              multi-core processors, which were still a fringe reality in 2011,
              and an improvement in multitasking management. Android 3.0
              Honeycomb is considered by many to be a flop due to the many
              problems present in the first version, which were marginally
              corrected with the 3.1 and 3.2 updates.

            <h3>Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich</h3>
            <p>
              On 19 October 2011, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus hit the market,
              bringing the new major release Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich to
              debut. The smartphone abandons physical navigation buttons in
              favour of on-screen buttons, a prerogative that still persists in
              Google-branded devices. The big news is the use of the Linux 3.0
              kernel, but there are also folders in the Home with a simple drag
              and drop, resizable widgets, the ability to monitor mobile data
              consumption, and Android Beam, which allows content to be shared
              between two smartphones using NFC. The interface is once again
              made with the Holo design, which debuted with Android 3.0 and sees
              for the first time the use of the Roboto font, developed in-house
              and optimised for high-resolution screens. The Menu button is
              replaced by the ``Recents'' button, which displays recently used
              applications. The Contacts section is moved from the Phone
              application to a separate application. The possibility of
              unlocking the smartphone by framing one's face arrives, although
              security is practically non-existent. Finally, Android 4.0 ICS
              introduces the possibility of taking screenshots by simultaneously
              pressing the Power and Volume Down buttons. The new Easter Egg is
              represented by a series of androids with cat ears and covered in
              biscuit and ice cream, with decidedly 'pixelated' graphics from
              8-bit arcade games.

            <h3>Android 4.1 jellybean</h3>
            <p>
              27 June 2012 saw the release of Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, a code
              name that was also used for two subsequent releases, Android 4.2
              and Android 4.3 released in the following months. The most
              important new feature introduced by version 4.1, which was
              accompanied at launch by the Nexus 7 tablet developed in
              collaboration with ASUS, is called Project Butter and promises to
              eliminate interface slowdowns, thus offering a much smoother user
              experience. To coincide with the launch of the first iteration of
              Jelly Bean also comes Nexus Q, a media player that quickly
              disappeared from the scene. Some of the concepts behind the device
              will be reused for Chromecast, a hugely successful device.
              Interactive notifications are introduced, allowing users to reply
              immediately to a message or perform other tasks. Google Now with
              its real-time information also arrives, paving the way for a new
              kind of assistance on mobile devices. The launch of Android 4.2
              Jelly Bean was somewhat overshadowed by two events: the
              presentation of the Nexus 4, the smartphone made by LG and
              according to many the most beautiful Nexus ever, and the Nexus 10
              tablet made by Samsung, and Hurricane Sandy, which forced Google
              to cancel the presentation event, replaced by a post on its
              official blog. With the second version of Jelly Bean comes Photo
              Sphere, multi-user management (reserved for tablets), the ability
              to swipe to type, screen sharing on a TV, and Daydream, which
              allows images or the clock to be shown while charging. There is no
              shortage of widgets on the unlock screen, quick settings that
              allow certain settings to be changed quickly, and the use of
              Google Chrome as the default browser. On 24 July 2013, Android 4.3
              Jelly Bean arrived, the third and last version with this name.
              Accompanying the little green robot is the Nexus 7 2013, a tablet
              once again made by ASUS. Among the new features introduced by the
              new version are support for Bluetooth LE (Low Energy), the
              possibility of creating user profiles with restricted access, and
              support for OpenGL ES 3.0. With Jelly Bean comes, of course, a new
              Easter Egg showing a candy on the screen. A long press will cause
              it to explode, scattering small candies around the screen.

            <h3>Android 4.4 KitKat</h3>
            <p>
              Officially announced on 3 September 2013, Android 4.4 KitKat hit
              the market almost two months later, on 31 October with the LG
              Nexus 5, one of the most popular Nexus devices among users. This
              is the first version of Android combined with a commercial
              product, Nestlé's KitKat biscuits. This is destined to be repeated
              in the future, even if a few years will have to pass. The
              development of the Holo interface is completed, reaching its peak
              of success before leaving the field for a new design to be
              introduced with the next version. 'Ok Google' arrives, a voice
              command that we have come to know by now and which allows us to
              send messages, receive directions or manage multimedia playback.
              Immersive design is introduced, allowing applications to hide the
              status bar and navigation bar to make use of the whole screen and
              offer a more enveloping experience. The ART runtime, destined to
              supplant Dalvik in later versions, makes its appearance, promising
              better power management. Project Svelte allows Android to run
              better in low-end devices, those with 512 MB RAM and
              low-resolution screens. Finally, it is possible to change the
              default application for handling messages, which with Android 4.4
              KitKat becomes Google Hangouts but can be replaced with the user's
              preferred one. The new Easter Egg is not particularly interesting,
              as it merely shows a 'K' that rotates with a press and displays a
              collage with previous versions, with decidedly psychedelic colors.

            <h3>Android 5.0 Lollipop</h3>
            <p>
              Starting with Android 5.0 Lollipop, Google introduces the
              Developer Preview system, which allows developers, and eager
              users, to install a preview of the new operating system. The first
              version is presented on 25 June 2014 during the Google I/O and is
              generically called Android L. The final name is not announced
              until 15 October 2014, during the official presentation at which
              the Motorola Nexus 6 smartphone, the HTC Nexus 9 tablet and the
              Nexus Player media player are also launched. The biggest novelty
              is a new user interface, designed in a flat and simple style:
              Material Design. Android 5.0 Lollipop undoubtedly represents the
              biggest change since Android was released, with a sometimes-sharp
              break with the past. It starts with the new ART runtime, which
              replaces the now obsolete Dalvik. Project Volta aims to improve
              the overall autonomy of devices. It is possible to unlock the
              smartphone with a Bluetooth device, such as a smartwatch, Heads Up
              notifications arrive, there is a new unlock screen that allows the
              camera to be launched. The 'Recents' screen is also redesigned
              with a three-dimensional stack showing open apps. Android 5.0
              Lollipop is the first version of the green dot to support 64-bit
              architecture, used for example by the Nvidia Tegra K1 chipset used
              on the HTC Nexus 9. For the first time, Android's Easter Egg is a
              game, based on one of the most popular games of 2015. Google calls
              it Flappy Droid and it is clearly inspired by Flappy Bird. You
              must try to get a little green robot through the lollipops, which
              are a simple but tricky obstacle.

              of Android, simply called Android M, at Google I/O on 28 May 2015.
              The final version, called Android 6.0 Marshmallow, is announced on
              17 August but has been available since 5 October 2015, a week
              after the presentation of the LG Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P, the
              last two devices in the Nexus range. The Pixel C tablet produced
              by Google is also presented on that occasion. New features include
              Now on Tap, which allows you to obtain information about the
              content of the screen by pressing the Home button, and
              authorization management, which allows you to know what
              information to share with the applications installed on your
              device. The most significant new feature is Doze, which manages
              stand-by power saving: background connections are limited to
              high-priority applications, but applications can be manually
              excluded from power management. With Android 6.0 Marshmallow comes
              native fingerprint reader support for unlocking devices and for
              Play Store purchases, and support for USB Type-C for charging and
              data transfer. Not changing much is the Easter Egg, which takes up
              the Flappy Droid theme introduced with Lollipop by replacing
              lollipops with marshmallows and introducing a chaotic multiplayer
              system.

            <h3>Android 7.0 Nougat</h3>
            <p>
              The first test version of Android N, later renamed Android 7.0
              Nougat, was announced on 9 March 2016 but the official release did
              not arrive until 22 August. It is not a Google-made device that
              brings the new release of the green robot to debut, but rather the
              LG V20. Instead, Google devices arrive on 4 October of the same
              year, the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL, and they get the new
              Android 7.1 Nougat version, with some exclusive features. Split
              Screen mode is introduced for smartphones, allowing two apps to be
              displayed on the screen, while a feature allowing some apps to be
              displayed in floating windows is hidden. A new notification
              curtain arrives, allowing grouping by individual app, and the Doze
              power management system is further evolved. It is possible to set
              background data traffic consumption by individual apps, a
              hamburger button is introduced that allows for quicker movement
              between submenus, and support for the Vulkan API for 3D rendering.
              Also worth mentioning are the native blocking of unwanted numbers,
              Project Svelte which reduces RAM consumption, a new JIT compiler
              and Android For Work, for managing the smartphone during working
              hours. Android 7.0 Nougat's Easter Egg is among the cutest ever
              presented by Big G. After a press on the Nougat N, a cat icon will
              appear on the screen. We then find a new tile to add to the quick
              settings, featuring a cat. After inserting it, an empty bowl
              appears, which when tapped allows you to choose the food to be
              used. After a few minutes, a notification arrives with the number
              of the cat you have 'caught'. You can repeat the operation ad
              infinitum and collect numerous cats.

            <h3>Android 8.0 Oreo</h3>
            <p>
              The first Developer Preview of Android O is unveiled on 21 March
              2017 and the final version, called Android 8.0 Oreo is announced
              on 21 August 2017. Once again, the new release of the green dot is
              available ahead of the presentation of the Google Pixel 2 and
              Google Pixel 2 XL, which only arrived on 4 October and for which
              Android 8.1 Oreo was released on 5 December. There are many new
              features in the new version, starting with Project Treble, which
              allows operating system updates to be decoupled from hardware
              updates. Channels in notifications arrive, which can be postponed
              until later with the Snooze function, picture-in-picture mode to
              run certain applications in a floating window, Bluetooth 5
              support, new restrictions on background applications to optimize
              battery consumption, and adaptive icons. Also announced was
              Android Go, a special version of Oreo intended to run on low-end
              devices, with 1 GB of RAM and reduced resources available. After
              Nougat's cats, Oreo's Easter Egg is not very intriguing and shows
              an octopus that can be dragged around the screen.

            <h3>Android 9.0 Pie</h3>
            <p>
              On 6 August 2018, Android version 9.0 was officially announced,
              bearing the simple name Pie in English. The main new feature is
              official support for the notch, the notch at the top of the screen
              that has been rampant in 2018 smartphones. The notification
              curtain, quick toggles and system pop-up windows, such as the
              power on/off menu, are updated and now have a more vibrant look
              and rounded corners. It is possible to choose how the system
              should behave when the USB cable is plugged in, edit screenshots
              and interact with applications even through the multitasking
              screen, with copy paste operations. The Ambient Display mode now
              shows the remaining charge percentage and quick toggles are
              organized in horizontal pages. Android 9.0 Pie promises better
              battery life thanks to adaptive battery, notifications can be
              customized and quick replies can be better managed. Dashboard, App
              Timer, Wind Down, Digital Wellbeing and Sush arrive, functions
              designed to reduce 'dependency' on the smartphone by acting on
              various system components. The Easter Egg is represented by a
              letter P with psychedelic colors that change when your finger
              touches the screen.

            <h3>Android 10</h3>
            <p>
              This is the first version to abandon the name of the candy,
              switching to a numbering system that is easier to remember. The
              change is somewhat epochal and helps give the operating system a
              more serious image. The logo changes, the colors change, although
              the new features of version 10 do not represent changes compared
              to previous versions, but rather a series of improvements. Dark
              mode arrives along with new gestures, for the backward function,
              which will no longer collide with the NavigationDrawer management.
              With the new operating system comes the new easter egg, which
              allows the Android 10 script to be scrolled and changed to Android
              Q.

            <h3>Android 11</h3>
            <p>
              Android 11 introduced better support for 5G network technology and
              foldable smartphones. It also improved the dark theme (Dark Mode
              or Night Mode depending on devices) and app access permission
              management. On September 8, 2020, the stable version was released
              to the public.

            <p>
              Among the most noticeable new features is a revamped user
              interface based on the Material You design language, an evolution
              of Material Design, which also introduces better support for
              gestures in full-screen use mode. In addition, support for the
              AVIF image file format has been introduced, and sharing via Wi-Fi
              has been simplified.The stable version was released to the public
              on October 4, 2021.
