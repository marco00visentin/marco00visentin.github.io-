                    One of the most interesting features on One UI is the Always
                    On Display (AOD), a feature available exploiting the
                    Samsung's Super AMOLED screen. By activating this mode, time
                    and notifications will show even when the smartphone is
                    locked without consuming a lot of battery. This is possible
                    because the screen does not consume energy in rendering
                    black pixel. In addition to that, the user can add some
                    widgets directly to the lock screen, for example Music,
                    Alarm, and Weather forecasts. From One UI 3 it is also
                    possible to choose dynamic lock screen, a feature that
                    changes the background every time the lock screen is on.

                    pulled out by swiping on the right side of the display. It
                    is possible to choose specific apps for this bar, but also
                    contacts or tools by downloading new Edge Panels from
                    Samsung store.

                    facilitate the integration between Samsung devices and
                    Windows computers. Thanks to the integration, a computer
                    running Windows 10 can use the apps installed on the Samsung
                    smartphone.

                    One UI integrates apps produced by Samsung including Camera
                    and Gallery. Compared to the stock Android version, these
                    apps show some improvements. The camera, for example,
                    features night mode and portrait mode even on the front
                    camera, where the latter makes the subject stand out from
                    the background. Even more interesting features are found in
                    the gallery, specifically in the editing menu. Besides
                    adjusting the brightness, colors and other common settings,
                    there are more interesting features based on Artificial
                    Intelligence. These features are called Photo Eraser, which
                    allows the user to remove elements from photos by
                    highlighting the parts to erase, and Photo Remaster, which
                    automatically improves photos with poor sharpness.

                    This function is like Samsung's Always On Display, a
                    technology allowed by an AMOLED display. However, the
                    aesthetic has been recently renewed. Huawei has worked a lot
                    on the artistic side of its Always On Display and enriched
                    it with animated elements. The goal of this function remains
                    showing the clock and notifications while the smartphone is
                    locked, but in Huawei devices these functions work only when
                    the user is looking at the smartphone. This feature can be
                    enabled from settings and is based on data provided by the
                    proximity sensor and the front camera.

                    the user's favorite apps. However, in this case the edge bar
                    also hosts a multitasking menu. When quitting an app, it
                    minimizes and gets rearranged in the top-right corner. By
                    clicking on the app's icon in the corner, the bar shows up
                    with all those apps still running in the background that can
                    be launched with another click.

                    For those who want to keep contents Private Space is a very
                    interesting feature. Once the Private Space is created,
                    photos, videos, files, contacts can be moved there and they
                    won't be visible on the main interface. To create a Private
                    Space, it is necessary to set a different password or
                    fingerprint from the main one. These contents will only be
                    visible if the smartphone is unlocked using the fingerprint
                    or password associated to Private Space. This feature is
                    particularly useful for users that want to use the phone for
                    both private and working purposes on the same device.

                    Just like Samsung, Huawei has an optimized mode for gaming
                    apps. Once a game is downloaded, it directly goes to a space
                    called Game Center. When the user launches the game from
                    there, a series of optimizations are enabled to maximize the
                    framerate. One of the most important features is Motion
                    Predict Engine, a rendering machine that, together with the
                    GPU, can predict the next frame in the game in order to
                    guarantee the maximum fluidity.

                    Just like One UI and EMUI, Xiaomi devices feature an Always
                    on Display. This mode shows the time and notifications even
                    when the display is locked. What makes MIUI different is the
                    Super Wallpaper. A super wallpaper is an interactive
                    background picturing nature and planets. The changes in the
                    wallpaper accompany the transitions from the Always on
                    Display to the lock screen to the homepage. The spectacular
                    zoom in and zoom out effects make the transition fluid and
                    aesthetically appealing.

                    MIUI, like EMUI, lacked an app drawer for a long time. Until
                    its second to last release, all the new apps would
                    automatically arrange themselves on the Homepage (without a
                    space that would contain all the icons). The App Drawer has
                    finally arrived with the latest release. It is now possible
                    on Xiaomi devices to swipe up and access a list of all the
                    apps organized in alphabetical order or divided by category.

                    The Control Center is a window that contains all the useful
                    shortcuts as an alternative to the classical Android
                    drop-down menu. Both the feature and the name are inspired
                    by iOS, and it also works exactly like on iPhone: by swiping
                    down on the left half of the status bar, the user can access
                    the notifications. The Control Center is accessible by
                    swiping down on the right side. Unlike Android smartphones,
                    this same space is not shared with notifications.

                    The MIUI 12 version has introduced floating windows, a
                    feature like the Multitasking of EMUI and One UI. This
                    feature allows to visualize superimposing applications and

                    As the name suggests, this feature is meant to maximize
                    battery life. To do so, the feature reduces background
                    activities and the number of usable apps (6 maximum, plus
                    Phone, Contacts and Messages). A very similar mode can be
                    found on Samsung One UI.

                    With the version of MIUI 12, Xiaomi has introduced Focus
                    Mode. The feature is meant to eliminate distractions coming
                    from the smartphone to let the user focus on something
                    important. When turned on, Focus Mode deactivates all the
                    features except for phone and camera.
